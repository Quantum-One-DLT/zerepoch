# Simeon: financial contracts on Bcc Computation Layer

Here we present a reference implementation of Simeon, domain-specific language targeted at
the execution of financial contracts in the style of Peyton Jones et al
on Bcc Computation Layer.

The implementation is based on semantics described in paper
['Simeon: financial contracts on blockchain'](https://blockchain-company.io/research/papers/#2WHKDRA8)
by Simon Thompson and Pablo Lamela Seijas
